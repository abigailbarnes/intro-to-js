Graded revision 4

Graded by: GLK

Non-coding portion:
#1a = 5/5 (identified, ideally with link, a game other than Set)
Uno - solid example
#1b = 20/20 (described effect of pair-wise distinguishability variation)
good account
#1c = 2/5 (90 words or less)
seem to have about 200 words

#2a = 3/3 (degrees kelvin)
#2b = 3/3 (Pokemon types)
#2c = 3/3 (Gregorian calendar dates)
#2d = 3/3 (crypto hashes)
#2e = 3/3 (CS dept rankings)
#2f = 3/3 (0 means absence)
#2g = 3/3 (star ratings)
#2h = 3/3 (Mohs' hardness)
#2i = 0/3 (log(V) versus V, meh)
ordinal not interval: log() will change size of intervals in a non-uniform way, but preserves ordering
#2j = 3/3 (time of day, avg'd)
#2k = 3/3 (#sec since Jan 1 1970)
ratio is valid, but that is a pretty arbitrary 0

Coding portion:
#3a = 2/2 (unaplus)
#3b = 2/2 (pfl)
#3c = 2/2 (gogotrcm)
#3d = 2/2 (jnsp)
#3e = 2/2 (detcWAT)
#3f = 2/2 (tetcWAT)
#3g = 1/2 (getpropdot)
but your code assumes a particular length array! better to say
ret = aa.map(d => d.cat);
#3h = 2/2 (adds)
#3i = 2/2 (tolo)
#3j = 2/2 (templit)
#3k = 2/2 (adder)
#3l = 2/2 (doubler)
#3m = 1/2 (squarer)
asked to use exponentiation operator: ret = aa.map((x) => x ** 2);
#3n = 2/2 (modulo)
#3o = 2/2 (sfxer)
#3p = 2/2 (filtels)
also ok: ret = aa.filter((s) => !(s.length % 2));
because of the way "!" works 
#3q = 1/2 (mchain)
correct but asked for separate lines (for hw1 only)
#3r = 2/2 (fmeaner)
#3s = 2/2 (rmeaner)
#3t = 2/2 (strdesc)
#3u = 2/2 (addidx)
can also say x.idx instead of x['idx'] because the property name is a literal not a variable
#3v = 2/2 (getfoo)
#3w = 2/2 (getpropbrac)

Grades for individual questions are indicated as a fraction E/T, where E is
what you earned, and T is the total possible.

Requests for reconsideration of a grade should be made as soon as possible (and
no later than a week after this grade was returned). Post a private note in the
hw1 Edstem category. Include:
 - your CNetID
 - the question you think was mis-graded
 - who graded it
 - why it should be regraded.
